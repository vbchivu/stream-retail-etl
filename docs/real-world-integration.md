# Real-World Integration Guide

**File:** `docs/real-world-integration.md`  
**Audience:** Product stakeholders, ops, and engineers  
**Goal:** Explain how this demo maps to a real retailer’s systems and what we’d add to run it for real.

---

## 1) The one-minute version (non-technical)

Think of **Kafka** as a fast, reliable conveyor belt for events (sales, returns, stock updates).

**Kafka Connect** is a robotic arm that moves events from the belt into **PostgreSQL** so analysts/dashboards can read them.

**ksqlDB** (optional) does “live math” on the belt (e.g., sales per minute per store).

**Prometheus + Grafana** are the control room: see health, rates, and alerts in near real time.

**Result:** HQ can watch sales within seconds, spot anomalies quickly, and act before issues hurt revenue.

## 2) Where data comes from (typical sources)

| Source System           | Examples                              | Integration Pattern |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------|
| POS / in-store tills   | sales, returns, voids                  | Webhook → HTTP receiver → Kafka; or CDC from POS DB via Debezium |
| E-commerce             | orders, payments, fulfillments         | Webhooks; platform APIs (poll→publish) |
| ERP / inventory / pricing | stock levels, product catalog, promos | CDC from ERP DB; scheduled API pull; S3 file drops |
| Payments / fraud       | auths, chargebacks, risk scores        | Webhooks; API polling |
| Store ops / devices    | lane status, opening hours             | MQTT/HTTP to gateway → Kafka |

*In this repo:* Synthetic producer simulates a steady stream. In production, replace or add to it with one or more real integrations above.

## 4) End-to-end examples

**A) Real-time sales monitoring**  
Goal: sales per minute per store; lag & health panels.  
Flow: POS → webhook → HTTP receiver → Kafka → (ksqlDB optional) → JDBC Sink → Grafana.

**B) Inventory health & stockout alerts**  
Goal: spot SKUs about to stock out.  
Flow: ERP CDC → Kafka → ksqlDB join → inventory_risks → PostgreSQL → Grafana.

**C) Order lifecycle tracking**  
Goal: follow an order through payment and fulfillment.  
Flow: E-commerce webhooks → Kafka → ksqlDB joins → JDBC Sink → Grafana.

## 5) Roles of each module (in context)

- **Ingress**: source connectors or microservices publishing to Kafka.
- **Kafka**: durable buffer and fan-out.
- **ksqlDB**: real-time aggregates, joins.
- **Kafka Connect JDBC Sink**: batched delivery to PostgreSQL.
- **PostgreSQL**: operational analytics.
- **Prometheus + Grafana**: metrics and dashboards.

---

## 6) How to adapt this repo for production

1. Replace synthetic producer with real sources (HTTP receiver, Debezium CDC, File/S3 ingestor).
2. Use **Schema Registry** with Avro/Protobuf.
3. Partition & index large Postgres tables.
4. Scale partitions and connector tasks.
5. Apply TLS/SASL, HTTPS, and data minimization.

---

## 7) Operations & controls

- Pause/resume ingestion via connector APIs.
- Grafana dashboards and alerts for visibility.

---

## 8) Performance sizing cheat-sheet

- 1M/day ≈ 11.57 events/sec  
- 10M/day ≈ 115.74 events/sec  

---

## 9) Mapping to the current repo

Already: Kafka, Postgres, JDBC Sink, Prometheus, Grafana, synthetic producer.  
Optional: ksqlDB + aggregates.

---

## 10) Next steps checklist

- Add real source connector.
- Introduce Schema Registry.
- Add Postgres partitioning.
- Define DLQ topics.
- Add control UI for connectors.

---

## 11) Glossary

- **CDC**: Change Data Capture.
- **DLQ**: Dead-Letter Queue.
- **Exactly-once**: Strong delivery guarantees.
